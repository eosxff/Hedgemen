Notes:
	- I use my own FNA natives, and may not always be up to date. If you would like to download your own visit:
		FNA downloads page: https://fna-xna.github.io/download/
		FNA natives archive file: https://fna.flibitijibibo.com/archive/fnalibs.tar.bz2

Linux:
	- If you are supplying/replacing the FNA+Native libraries, rename each "X.so.0" to "X.so".
